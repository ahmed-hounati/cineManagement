# Cinema Management Application

## Project Overview

This project is a cinema management application designed to handle various tasks such as managing films, reservations, theaters (salles), screenings (s√©ances), and available seats. It also includes user authentication for both customers and administrators. Customers can create their accounts, view available films, and book seats for screenings. Administrators manage the system, including creating films, scheduling screenings, managing reservations, and adding other administrators.

- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication.
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error responses during CRUD operations.

### Database
